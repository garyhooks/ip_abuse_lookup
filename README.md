Version 2.0 of this tool will check a list of ip addresses within the file ips.txt agains three different IP abuse services, these are:

1) AbuseIPDB
2) Scamalytics
3) IPQualityScore

Results are output for each of these in a tabuler form. In addition, a csv list is output including links to all services and a link to a Google search page too.

Finally a plain text of "bad IPs" are output too.

Users can remove any services they don't wish to have or add more if needed.
